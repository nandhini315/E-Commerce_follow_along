# Ecommerce Follow Along Project
Welcome to the *Ecommerce Follow Along Project*, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack(MongoDB,Express.js,React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview 

#### 1.Understanding the MERN Stack:
*MongoDB :* A Database for storing application data ina felexible , document based format.
*Express.js :* A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling serve logics.
*React.js :* A framework library for building user Interfaces.
*Node.js :* A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

#### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communicaton btween the frontend and backend.
we'll create APIs for :
- *User Authentication*: Allowing users to register and log in .
- *Product Management*: Adding , updating , and retrieving product data.
- *Order Handling*:Managing customer orders.

#### 3. Database Schema Design 
WE'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB . A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.

#### 4. Authentication 
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to logm in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.
